### Step 1. Set up the Development Environment
	
  - You need to set up your development environment before you can do anything.

	- Verify that you are running at least node 6.9.x and npm 3.x.x by running node -v and npm -v in a 
    terminal/console window. Older versions produce errors, but newer versions are fine.
